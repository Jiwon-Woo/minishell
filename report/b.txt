==60248== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==60248== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==60248== or are doing some strange experiment):

==60248== 
==60248== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==60248==   /path/to/gdb ./minishell
==60248== and then give GDB the following command
==60248==   target remote | /usr/local/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-eec4cf7/libexec/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=60248
